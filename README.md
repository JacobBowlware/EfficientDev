## What I Learned
When creating this project, the majority of the challenges I faced had to do with TypeScript. This being my first project that involves TypeScript, I was not surprised. However, after overcomming these challenges with TypeScript and learning more about the benefits of types in JavaScript, I am glad I took on this challenge. I will most certainly continue using TypeScript in future projects as it adds a much needed layer of type checking and security to the code I write.
